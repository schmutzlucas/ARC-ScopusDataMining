This project will work with fisheries managers and the environmental consulting sector, and focus on sites in the Kimberley, Cocos-Keeling Islands, Fremantle and Deep-sea oil/gas sites to demonstrate the value of eDNA methods in best-practice monitoring. A multi-proxy toolkit (including eDNA) that can audit and baseline marine biota could make balancing conservation and sustainable exploitation achievable. Anticipated outcomes are improved management and monitoring of fisheries, ports and offshore oil/gas sites.","lead-investigator":"Prof Michael Bunce","current-funding-amount":303817.00,"announced-funding-amount":292169,"grant-status":"Closed","primary-field-of-research":"0502 - Environmental Science and Management","anticipated-end-date":"2019-09-15","investigators":"Dr Stephen Newman; Prof Michael Bunce; Prof Euan Harvey; Dr Michael Stat; Dr Joseph DiBattista; Prof Marcus Gilbert","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"http://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP160100839"}},{"type":"grants","id":"FL160100101","attributes":{"code":"FL160100101","scheme-name":"Australian Laureate Fellowships","funding-commencement-year":2016,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"FL","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2015,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"FL16 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"University of Tasmania","announcement-admin-organisation":"University of Tasmania","grant-summary":"Disaggregating and modelling the impacts of land-use change on biodiversity. Disaggregating and modelling the impacts of land-use change on biodiversity. This project aims to systematically analyse contemporary and historical data on agriculture, energy use and urbanisation, to identify the consumption and technology pathways that can most effectively mitigate the future extent and impact of land-use change. This synthesis is expected to develop new forecasting and optimisation tools using an innovative hierarchical meta-modelling approach. A key outcome would be to resolve inherent global and national trade-offs between ongoing human development and the competing need to conserve habitats, ecosystems, and species.","lead-investigator":"Prof Barry Brook","current-funding-amount":3058559.00,"announced-funding-amount":2864368,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0502 - Environmental Science and Management","anticipated-end-date":"2021-12-31","investigators":"Prof Barry Brook; Dr Emily Flies; Mr Vishesh Diengdoh; Miss Lucile Lévêque","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"http://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/FL160100101"}},{"type":"grants","id":"LP160100996","attributes":{"code":"LP160100996","scheme-name":"Linkage Projects","funding-commencement-year":2016,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"LP","program":"Linkage","submissionYear":2015,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"LP16 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"Murdoch University","announcement-admin-organisation":"Murdoch University","grant-summary":"Optimising fire management for a resilient future. Optimising fire management for a resilient future. This project aims to quantify how changes in fire frequency, fire season, invasive weeds and climate interact to affect native species’ persistence. Fire risk management is a conundrum for agencies responsible both for protection of life and property and biodiversity conservation. Global change factors (rainfall decline, warming, invasive species, ecosystem fragmentation) interact with changes in fire regime (interval and season) associated with prescribed burning to affect native species’ regeneration capacity. Anticipated outcomes are fuel reduction burning policy and management changes that balance and minimise risk of fire to economy, society and biodiversity.","lead-investigator":"Prof Neal Enright","current-funding-amount":480633.00,"announced-funding-amount":455000,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0502 - Environmental Science and Management","anticipated-end-date":"2022-01-22","investigators":"Dr Ben Miller; Prof Neal Enright; Dr Joseph Fontaine","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"http://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP160100996"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP160100661","attributes":{"code":"DP160100661","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2016,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2015,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP16 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"The University of Melbourne","announcement-admin-organisation":"The University of Melbourne","grant-summary":"Genetic rescue, restoration and adaptation. This project aims to evaluate a promising but rarely used method of population recovery by genetically rescuing populations of two threatened Australian mammals: the mountain pygmy possum and the eastern barred bandicoot. Despite our best efforts to curb biodiversity loss, extinction rates are increasing and Australia is expected to lose a substantial proportion of its unique endemic fauna over the next 20–50 years. By tracking the phenotypic and underlying genomic changes that occur when a population undergoes a genetic rescue, the project aims to create data of interest to conservation biology.","lead-investigator":"Prof Ary Hoffmann","current-funding-amount":360399.00,"announced-funding-amount":342300,"grant-status":"Closed","primary-field-of-research":"0502 - Environmental Science and Management","anticipated-end-date":"2019-03-31","investigators":"Prof Ary Hoffmann; Dr Andrew Weeks","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"http://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP160100661"}}]}

This project aims to determine the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by small streams across the Australian tropics, a potential hotspot for emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. The project expects to investigate the controls on gaseous emissions from stream to regional scales using a novel combination of gas tracer experiments, remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Expected outcomes include the development of a predictive model of gas exchange and the first estimate of gaseous emissions from the Australian tropics. This should provide significant benefits such as reducing uncertainties on the national carbon budget and avoiding misalignment of greenhouse gas abatement policies.",

This project will investigate how heat wave attributes (duration, intensity, frequency), species attributes (physiology, behaviour, plasticity) and landscape features (refuges, fire, grazing) interact and contribute to lethal and sublethal effects of extreme heat on desert mammals.  Modelling will predict changes in desert mammal assemblages under different climatic and land management scenarios. Results will inform fire and grazing management, threatened species recovery programs and arid zone restoration.  ",

This project expects to develop new high throughput technologies and data interrogation techniques for predicting seed lifespan in storage, and alternative storage protocols for problematic seeds. Results will allow seed bank managers to more efficiently triage and curate their seed collections and will benefit seed banks globally.",

The aim of this project is to transform organic residues from meat processing into agricultural soil amendments that actively improve nutrient retention and reduce nitrous oxide (a potent greenhouse gas) emissions. Current disposal and treatment options for meat processing residues are economically and environmentally unsustainable. In this research, a modified hydrothermal carbonisation process will be developed to transform organic residues into novel hydrochars. The influence of these hydrochars on soil nutrient retention and nitrous oxide production will then be assessed using stable isotope tracing, genetic characterisation, and numerical modeling. The project will reduce the economic and environmental costs of organic waste disposal.",

By combining a range of novel geochemical, isotopic and palaeontological techniques, this research seeks to reveal the causes and consequences of Australia’s transformation from a forested to mainly open landscape of grassland, shrubland and savannah. The expected outcome is detailed knowledge of how changes in fire and rain shaped the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. This knowledge is key to understanding how Australian ecosystems function and to protecting their cultural, economic and environmental values, especially as climate and fire regimes continue to change into the future.",

The measurements have become feasible due to newly developed experimental and analytical methods, which avoid the problems that have bedevilled previous attempts.",

This project aims to reveal the continental pattern of soil carbon (C) response to warming in fire-affected ecosystems across Australia and to unravel the biogeochemical mechanisms underlying fire’s role in shaping the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Fire has modified over 40% of the Earth’s land surface and wildfire frequency is predicted to increase under global warming. This project expects to generate new knowledge on how fire influences soil-to-atmosphere C fluxes in a warmer climate using a multi-disciplinary approach. Expected outcomes include an enhanced capacity to predict the terrestrial ecosystem-to-atmosphere C fluxes and their feedbacks to climate under increasing frequency of fire using Earth-system models.

Such knowledge will help us to better understand how the Earth System evolved as a whole, and how such an evolution has led to the present day life and environment on Earth.",

This project will improve our understanding of the role played by airborne particles in global climate, pollution and the transmission of influenza, corona virus and the common cold. It will do so by revealing the wider importance of \"glassy states\" of matter recently revealed in atmospheric aerosols. Glassy states are highly unpredictable quasi solids that abruptly form, interrupting the transition of a liquid to a solid. This interruption invalidates equilibrium assumptions of models of droplets as cloud nuclei and infection vectors. We will develop and validate a numerical tool for predicting glassy state formation and its impact in broad classes of aerosol that include particles critical to cloud formation and infection transmission.",

Most current approaches to shoreline protection involve the use of ecologically damaging hard structures.

With rising sea-levels, the need for coastal protection will increase, so it is essential that we develop ecologically sustainable approaches to shoreline protection.  The aim of this study is to assess changes to biodiversity and ecosystem functions associated with different protection strategies.  The research outcomes will be an understanding of the broad ecological impacts from these approaches and will provide the basis for ecologically sustainable shoreline protection in coastal lakes and lagoons.",

Computational resources limit the resolution of our models for such long runs, meaning that some key physical processes remain unresolved and must be parameterised. This project uses machine learning to find new parameterisations for unresolved ocean processes. These new parameterisations will be implemented into computationally cheaper coarse-resolution ocean models, thereby enhancing these models' representation of the ocean circulation. This project expects to reveal the dynamics of unresolved processes, to improve the accuracy of climate projections and to provide a proof-of-concept for how machine learning can be used in ocean and climate science.",

This project will use a range of innovative geochemical techniques to constrain the timing and extent to which the continents were emergent (above sea-level) throughout Earth’s history and its impact on climatic evolution. Continental emergence was pivotal to the development of our habitable planet, as it controlled the influx of bioessential elements, like phosphorus, to the oceans. Expected outcomes include a detailed record of changes in ocean chemistry, and a time integrated model for the emergence of continents on the early Earth. Documenting the impact of changes in the solid Earth on evolution is not only of interest to society in general, but also contributes to understanding the formation of Australia’s vast iron ore deposits.",

Consumption of resources is the major driver of biodiversity loss yet understanding of how to change behavioural drivers is lacking. This project aims to understand barriers to biodiversity behaviours across a supply chain, how to overcome them and increase positive biodiversity impact via spillover effects. We will use coffee as a case study to test specific interventions, design effective message frames for reducing the psychological distance of consumption behaviours and develop a framework for generalising to other behaviours impacting biodiversity. The project is expected to generate new knowledge and approaches critical for policy makers and other actors seeking to reduce consumptive impacts on biodiversity.",

Management of gas and water resources is of significant importance to the Australian economy and society. Industry and government use digital modelling to assist in resources management. The first step in modelling is to correlate geological data and then use geostatistics to estimate properties in areas without data. This project aims to produce a new geological framework for the Surat Basin underpinned by new zircon ages and ages of fossils in sediments and a new geostatistical methodology to better represent flow properties in coal seams and aquifers. This is expected result in a more accurate modelling methodology that can be used by industry and government for modelling resources, including in other basins in Australia and worldwide.",

Translocation is a conservation strategy to help the plight of endangered species, and is becoming increasing important to mitigate against climate change. However translocations often fail. Theory suggests mixing individuals from different source populations would benefit species' genomic diversity and potentially success rates, however this is untested in animals. Also unclear is what parts of the genome are important for mitigating against climate change. Using an endangered lizard model, this project aims to understand how to best start new populations by 1) providing the first empirical test in terrestrial vertebrates of using mixed source populations; and 2) uncovering regions of the genome important for considering in translocations.",

This research aims to develop, for the first time, a model to reliably forecast the moisture content of live fuels (e.g. the foliage and fine branches of shrubs and trees). This will be achieved by combining (i) satellite-derived estimates of live fuel moisture content, (ii) forecasts of soil moisture, and (iii) plant physiological responses to soil dryness. Forecasts of live fuel moisture content will deliver an early warning system of the risk of bushfires. These forecasts will also facilitate improved planning of prescribed burns: if fuels are too dry there is a risk of burns escaping, conversely, if fuels are too wet there is a risk that burns will fail to meet objectives.",

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play a key role in earth system processes but little is known about the amount of BVOCs emitted, and the mechanisms underlying their production in marine habitats, despite these being potential hotspots for BVOC emissions. The aim of this proposal is to custom build a portable equilibrator inlet proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer for measurements of BVOC’s in coastal waters. This will be the first such instrument in the southern hemisphere and it will enable us to make in situ, high-precision measurements which will lead to ground-breaking advances that will revolutionise our understanding of BVOC cycling in coastal environments and their influence on the global climate system.\n",

This project aims to increase the predictability of seasonal droughts that cause major socio-economic losses in rural Australia. The capacity to predict drought, and in particular its impacts on the land, is currently limited by the low skill of forecast models. Using novel observations, the project expects to quantify the vulnerability of Australian agricultural lands to seasonal droughts. The new knowledge will then be used to modify land processes in the Bureau of Meteorology’s seasonal prediction system to better reflect Australian conditions. This project is expected to improve forecasts of high impact droughts, crucial to mitigate socio-economic risks, and should benefit decision-making in agriculture and other industries.",

Fire represents a major natural hazard, and its impact on Australian communities and ecosystems is increasing. Representing a world first, this project aims to calibrate the paleofire signal from stalagmites in shallow caves, and to construct annually resolved stalagmite records of paleofire frequency and intensity for the last millennia. The project aims to use stalagmites from south west Australia to determine the relationship between fire and climate and assess the robustness of stalagmite hydroclimate proxies in fire-prone regions. This project expects to establish a new research field for speleothem science, enhancing capacity for the Australian Quaternary and speleothem research communities, as well as benefits to land managers.",

This project will reconstruct past climate, rainfall, water quality, coral bleaching and reef ecology feedbacks across Great Barrier Reef death events to establish which environmental stressors and paleoclimate variations are most critical for reef health.

Since mosses, the dominant plants of Antarctica, preserve a record of past climate down their shoots they can be used as surrogates to study how both ecosystems and climate are changing at remote polar sites. Outcomes will include improved climate data for Antarctica, enabling more robust analysis of regional climate change, and development of ultrahigh-resolution techniques capable of non-destructively monitoring Antarctic ecosystem health.

The proposed work aims to apply state-of-the-art chemical analysis of natural samples and investigate gas-solid reactions experimentally to determine how chemical elements, including metals, are distributed in these reactions.

This project will test a new hypothesis that the two types of magmas originate from distinct mantle sources. It integrates novel high-pressure experiments with database analysis of natural volcanic rocks, covering magmatic systems from mantle source to volcano.

This project aims to determine the sensitivity of the seismic properties of Earth’s upper mantle (to 400 km depth) to variations in the prevailing chemical environment. The unique capability of the ANU Rock Physics Laboratory for low-frequency measurement of wave speeds and attenuation will be exploited to clarify the newly discovered importance of redox conditions, and document the effect of varying proportions of the most abundant upper-mantle minerals olivine and pyroxene. The expected outcome will be a robust and comprehensive model to guide the interpretation of the complex architecture of the upper mantle, and thereby provide an improved understanding of the tectonic processes responsible for its evolution through geological time.",

This project aims to provide new strategies for more effective mineral targeting by testing the hypothesis that anomalous magmatism enriched in metals reflects particular styles of deformation, such as tears in subducting slabs. We will use geophysical modelling to constrain slab structure along the northern boundary of the Australian plate, and geochemical data to establish spatio-temporal links with anomalous magmatism and ore deposits. By identifying the geochemical fingerprint of tear-related magmatism, outcomes are expected to benefit geoscience research and mineral exploration by providing context to similar rock associations in mineral-rich provinces.",

The crust shaped the composition of the atmosphere and the oceans with consequences for the evolution of life through the availability of oxygen and nutrients. However, when and how the continental crust was generated remains a core question. Current models for continental crust development rely on the mineral zircon. However, zircons only record the history of evolved rocks. To address this bias we will use the mineral apatite which forms in less evolved rocks. We will develop a detrital apatite database of Pb-Nd (model) ages and integrate this with the zircon record to provide a more holistic description for how our planet developed.",

Anticipated outcomes and benefits include a paradigm shift in knowledge of how predator-prey dynamics shaped the first animal ecosystems, new approaches for studying the functional morphology and microevolutionary patterns of extinct invertebrates, and highlighting the international significance of Australia’s natural heritage.",

Anthropogenic sea level rise is expected to inundate low-lying islands and coastlines around the world, with multiple model projections suggesting that changes in wind patterns will lead to larger than average sea level rise along Australia’s east coast and in neighbouring small island nations. Confidence in projections of this spatial sea level rise variability is low, however, due to a strong mismatch between patterns of observed and model-projected sea level rise in recent decades. This work will use a newly developed climate model hierarchy and innovative experimental design to determine the cause of this discrepancy and will produce more credible regional sea level rise projections by clarifying and reducing projection uncertainty.\n",

The expected outcomes include new pest control tools that make strategic use of misinformation to alter decision making, to reduce a pest's ability to damage important agricultural crops such as wheat, boost the attraction of lures to traps, and improve bait uptake.

Melting Antarctic ice sheets are responsible for 28% of global sea level rise in recent decades, and can contribute more than 1 metre of sea level rise by year 2100, and a staggering 15 metres by 2500. Increased glacial melt rates are best understood by studying changes in the circulation of water around the Antarctic coastline. The combination of physical processes that must be resolved in this region places a high demand on ocean observations and modelling systems. This project uses a series of high-resolution ocean and ice experiments, cross-validated with observations, to provide a deeper understanding of how waters at the Antarctic margin respond to both anthropogenic and natural climate forcing.",

This project will evaluate how the Antarctica's great thaw may fertilise the Southern Ocean with iron and help mitigate carbon dioxide emissions now and in the future. The Southern Ocean is anaemic, meaning that the iron levels are too low to sustain photosynthesis, a pathway by which the oceans transform carbon dioxide into carbon-rich sediments. There is evidence that melting ice may supply substantial amount of iron, capable of boosting marine life and removing carbon dioxide. As polar regions show the earliest and most severe impacts of anthropogenic activity, studying ice-ocean interactions is central to supporting national and international policy development that can effectively limit the worst impacts of climate change globally.

This project aims to investigate how the season of fire, arguably one of the biggest changes brought about by fire management, can impact ecosystems and the persistence of threatened species. The project expects to generate new yet fundamental knowledge of how the timing of fire has shifted, using a multidisciplinary team with expertise in remote sensing and fire ecology, and experimentally assess fire season effects on soil properties and plant persistence. The project aims to enhance capacity of conservation agencies across Australia to effectively implement fires while maintaining biodiversity values. This should provide significant benefits for informed management of the large numbers of threatened species under their protection.",

Of all the climatic factors determining species distributions, temperature is arguably the most important. It is extremes – rather than averages – that drive species evolution. So it is concerning that although extreme temperature events are increasing in frequency and intensity little is known about the breadth of thermal tolerance of plants from extreme environments. This information is crucial to understand species distribution and survival under future climate regimes. This project will ascertain the thermal breadth of Australian species growing in situ and under controlled environments. The project will contribute to development of effective conservation, restoration and rehabilitation plans for Australian native plant communities. ",

The project will develop and test a new global standard for the assessment and reporting on ecological condition of internationally important wetlands, listed under the Ramsar Convention. It has four aims: establishment of a strategic adaptive management and governance framework, a meta-analysis of the 2,303 internationally listed wetlands, development of a protocol for assessment and prediction and delivering a digital reporting platform for effective management. The project is significant because it tackles the decline of freshwater ecosystems, by targeting the most prominent wetlands. It also assists state and national governments to meet their obligations under the Ramsar Convention and most importantly guides more effective management.",

While much stratigraphic characterization has been based on detrital zircon ages & their correlation to basement sources, two major limitations are apparent: a) zircon may be multicycle, blurring source-sink relationships, b) zircon may be absent in mafic lithologies thus biasing investigations. In this work K-feldspar & apatite provenance investigation will be undertaken on a state wide basis and include case studies in the Yilgarn Craton and Canning & Northern Carnarvon Basins.\n",

Every day, Australians produce ~5 billion litres of wastewater, which contains a cocktail of chemicals. Industries that discharge wastewater are required to assess chemical risks to the receiving environments by conducting whole animal direct toxicity assessments (DTA), which are expensive and pose an ethical dilemma. Our preliminary research shows that new in vitro bioassays provide an ethical and cost effective alternative that could be incorporated into DTA programs if their ecological relevance can be demonstrated. This project will develop and validate a new and internationally significant suite of in vitro bioassays for incorporation into DTA programs, leading to more ethical, cost effective and improved environmental protection.",

After the drought, streamflow generation is yet to recover in some catchments.

This project aims to establish a physical basis for the sensitivity of seismic observations to small changes in the great ice sheets of East Antarctica. These ice sheets are vulnerable to partial collapse or accelerated retreat. Early changes in such ice sheets may take place in the hidden ice-rock interface zone and could be detected by subtle changes in seismic signals that pass through layers of ice, sediments, water and bedrock in this zone. This project will undertake computer simulations, run tests on pre-existing data and examine two case studies, the Aurora and Wilkes Basins. The outcomes of this research will provide a basis for an early warning of ice sheet collapse using seismology, and contribute to future increased resilience to sea level rise.",

This project aims to comprehensively understand the interconnected processes by which oceanic heat is circulated towards Antarctica. The risk of rapid ocean warming at the Antarctic margin is profound, with change already detected via deep ocean warming, land-ice melt, and ice shelf collapse. Yet this region remains poorly understood, with only limited observations due to both a harsh environment and a lack of standard data streams. This project will use high-resolution global and regional ocean/sea-ice models to examine mechanisms for rapid warming of Antarctic continental shelf waters via both large-scale drivers and fine-scale processes, including mesoscale eddies, tide-topography interactions, and bottom boundary flows. This work will better constrain future rates of ice melt around Antarctica by providing vital knowledge of the ocean processes, dynamics, and feedbacks relating to warm water intrusion onto the Antarctic continental shelf.",

This project will use a series of laboratory experiments to test whether parts of the ocean surface can be warmed beyond this limit under natural conditions.

This project aims to use matchstick grasshoppers as a model system to develop strategies and protocols for maximising the adaptive potential of species when movement of individuals or genes is required. Biodiversity management increasingly requires translocation or targeted gene flow to maintain genetic diversity, raising the issue of disrupting local environmental adaptations. Matchstick grasshoppers are extremely well understood genetically, are highly amenable to experimental investigation, and include populations and species threatened by habitat destruction. This project will generate novel conservation tools for the focal species as well as empirical precedents for resolving the problem of environmental mismatch in translocation.",

This project aims to assess how past conditions influence grassland responses to the rising atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide.

By synthesising data from past experiments, this project aims to determine exactly why grasslands fail to realise the full productivity benefits of increased CO2 and when this will happen. This should improve predictions of carbon exchange and indicating the best direction for climate change adaptation measures.",

By improving our understanding of the geochemical behaviour of the rare earths this project aims to develop new reverse-engineering methods for their extraction, which will improve the security of supply of these elements and enhance Australia's role in high-tech industries. The project will enhance the profitability of the Australian resources sector through improved extraction economics and will secure the supply of these critical metals for Australian high-tech industries and export.

Surprisingly little is known about key issues surrounding the origin of water and its subsequent recycling on Earth. This project will use new techniques for measuring low abundances of water along with oxygen isotopes, to measure water abundances and oxygen isotopes in meteorites and terrestrial rocks to establish how water was delivered to Earth and to understand how water is geologically recycled. This is expected to have direct bearing on where and how Earth's water originated, how water is retained in mantle and crustal minerals and it will have broad implications for understanding volcanic hazards and formation of ore deposits. This will lead to a new capability for combined water and oxygen isotope analysis in Australian geoscience leading to technological development and commercialisation of instrumentation.",

This project aims to investigate the impact of global environmental change on the survival of Australia’s oyster industry, by combining the science of genetics, physiology and ecology to identify already resilient oysters. Through the first complete understanding of resilience in oysters, including the trade-offs they have made in other fitness traits, the project develops new capacities to 'climate and future-proof' our natural oyster populations and the Australian oyster industry, to enable the restoration of degraded oyster habitats. This project will ensure the future of an iconic and economically important national industry and food source and contribute to preserving the critical cultural links of Indigenous Australians with their lands.",

Various approaches, including biomechanics, three-dimensional imaging, geochemistry and quantitative palaeobiology will unravel how and when filter feeding emerged, how it diversified over time, and whether its evolution correlated with past environmental change. The project is expected to reveal clues on how whales became one of the greatest ecological actors in the sea, and will benefit conservation by providing a glimpse into their future.",

Geochronology is the science of determining the ages of rocks and geological events, and is key to answering fundamental questions of planetary evolution, the geological processes that shaped our Earth, and evolution of life and past climates. Many valuable mineral phases are too small to be dated by conventional methods. The potential that nano-geochronology has to unlock information otherwise untraceable remains largely unexplored. The development and application of nano-geochronology will improve our understanding of the Australian crust and the field of geological mapping, which largely supports mineral exploration.",

This project aims to reveal the role of diet in the spread and subsequent dominance of Mesozoic dinosaurs.

This project will use 3D scans of dinosaur teeth to calculate anatomical indicators of diet, and interpret diet as a continuous variable which will permit unprecedented evolutionary analyses of dinosaur ecology. Anticipated outcomes include an innovative framework with which to reconstruct the ecological diversity of dinosaurs from Australia and around the world and understand the processes that led to their success for over 150 million years.",

Using a unique turbulence-resolving approach and high-performance computing, the project will determine both the global role of buoyancy-driven convection in the broad ocean circulation and the local turbulence controls on melting rates of Antarctic ice-shelves.

This project aims to investigate the link between continent motion and mantle upwelling over the last billion years by combining tectonic reconstructions and recently developed dynamic earth models with the global and Australian rock record. Mantle upwelling is thought to cause eruptions of large volcanic provinces and kimberlites, the primary source rock for diamonds. The project expects to develop a technique to map kimberlite potential in under-explored regions such as Australia. Significant benefits from the project will be the reduction of economic risks in diamond exploration, the training of a researcher in exploration geodynamics, and understanding the link between supercontinents and mantle upwelling.",

These data will then form the basis for focused human biomonitoring using pooled surplus pathology samples.  The integration of wastewater and biomonitoring data will allow the creation of a national hazard specific exposure map that can be compared with geospatial data on disease risk and socioeconomic indicators (via ABS information).  The benefits include the capability to identify and manage exposure risks to public health.",

Turbulent mixing is caused by internal waves which transport energy from the ocean boundaries into the interior, where they drive mixing of cold, deep water with warmer water above. This mixing is crucial to the ocean circulation which controls the storage of heat and carbon in the ocean, but is inadequately represented in current climate models. The anticipated outcome of the project is an enhanced, global-ocean model incorporating an accurate description of turbulent mixing. This should provide significant benefits to the Australian community by improving the accuracy of future climate predictions.",

This project aims to develop a mathematical framework to better simulate the occurrence of sustained anomalies, such as droughts and long periods of flooding, into the future. These events increase water insecurity and result in loss of revenue, livelihoods and lives. Hydrological planning requires knowledge of how such sustained extremes will change in the future. Current alternatives for simulating such changes for future climates are inadequate for catchment-scale planning to proceed. The project proposes a strategy for post-processing hydrological simulations of the future using an elegant frequency-domain approach. It expects to provide the tools needed to develop hydrologic infrastructure, such as water supply reservoirs, that secure our water resources for the generations to come.",

This subglacial heat flux is poorly constrained in current ice sheet models, but directly affects ice sheet behaviour. The output of this project will be a greatly improved heat flux map for East Antarctica that can be used in ice sheet modelling studies. This should drive significant improvement in models for the evolution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in more accurate projections of ice discharge and associated sea level change.",

This project will examine how temporal and spatial salinity variations lead to large density gradients that may trigger unstable pore-water flow and solute transport. The outcomes will advance our understanding of fundamental links between the marsh hydrology and ecology, and improve our scientific basis for evaluating the marsh ecosystem under different stress conditions.",

The facility will contribute to a broad range of Australia’s theoretical and applied problems in geoscience and geobiology.",

Using a powerful combination of landscape-scale field observations, experimental manipulations of animal densities, and modelling, the project expects to quantify interactions between animals, bushfire fuel and fire regimes in south eastern Australian forests, woodlands and scrublands. This evidence should benefit the design of integrated, efficient, and complementary strategies for fire and fauna management in Australia’s extensive fire-prone ecosystems.",

The project expects to provide a well-dated sequence for Kimberley rock art based on replication of results, confirmation across different methods, and a large interdisciplinary data set. The  project will allow rigorous analysis of the relationship between dating results and rock art styles that has not previously been possible, and give new insights into Australia’s deep indigenous heritage. This will have a significant impact for future efforts in rock art conservation, and lay a foundation for cultural tourism, with important benefits for the local economy and health of regional indigenous communities.",

This project aims to build systems models of local environmental impacts of beef production coupled with models of global beef trade to analyse production and policy scenarios. Beef is the food commodity with the largest ecological footprint, and increased production will have globally significant impacts on land and water resources, biodiversity, and climate. The scale of these impacts depends on where and how cattle production occurs. Outcomes of this research include a framework for projecting regional and global ecological impacts of domestic cattle production policies, allowing informed decisions that consider and benefit environmental and socio-economic values.",

This project aims to combine innovative mathematical methods and new genetic data to accurately predict the larval dispersal patterns of reef fish and corals. Larval dispersal is central to the ecology of coral reefs, and has vital implications for conservation. Most marine organisms spend their early life dispersing in the ocean, but our understanding of where these tiny larvae go is limited by sparse data and unvalidated models. Applied to extensive case-studies from Australia and across the western Pacific Ocean, these methods will be used to forecast and understand the recovery of fish and coral populations following severe disturbances. This will provide benefits such as enabling us to prioritise conservation actions in the aftermath of severe disturbances,                                                                                                 including the catastrophic 2016 mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef.",

This project aims to employ targeted field observations, numerical simulations and new satellite capabilities to identify the dynamical and microphysical mechanisms that enhance and redistribute precipitation across the alpine regions of south eastern Australia and Tasmania. These observations will be used to evaluate operational numerical weather simulations specifically focusing on quantitative precipitation forecasts and estimates. The observations will also be used to extend known biases in the national gridded precipitation analysis that are a result of the complex mountain terrain. This identification of the physical processes that enhance and redistribute precipitation over the alpine regions across south east Australia and Tasmania will lead to better precipitation estimates and forecasts and better water management.",

This project aims to find new methods of copper recovery from low grade copper ores, which are currently uneconomic to mine. In nature, at the top of ore deposits and just below the water-table, is a region known as the supergene zone.  Here mild oxidizing reactions take place causing primary ore minerals such as chalcopyrite to be replaced by more copper-rich, less refractory minerals.  These processes are driven by dissolution re-precipitation reactions (CDR reactions) and in many CDR reactions, the reaction mechanism, rather than intensive properties such as pressure and temperature, control the nature of the products and the overall reaction process.  This project will explore the mechanism and controls on these reactions to see if they can be utilized in the mining industry to economically extract copper from low grade ores.\n\n",

This project aims to accurately determine Antarctica’s contribution to present-day sea-level. Large technique-specific systematic errors make this uncertain and controversial with the sign of change not agreed. Three of four measurement techniques rely on knowing the solid earth's changing shape or gravity field. Studies have not considered post-seismic deformation, but GPS data show that Antarctica has deformed since the 1998 Magnitude-8.2 Antarctic Plate Earthquake. This project will develop a model of these earthquakes constrained by geodetic data and use the model to estimate Antarctica's contribution to sea-level change. This should enable more confident local, national and international planning. This will benefit society through reducing the sea-level projection uncertainty.",

This project aims to incorporate carbon capture and storage into natural gas production from energy reserves. Carbon sequestration could assist in achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Injecting carbon dioxide into natural gas reservoirs or methane hydrate sands would be a nearly carbon-neutral means of energy production. However, this exchange of carbon dioxide for methane is poorly understood in both reservoirs and sands because multiple phases like water and sand affect mixing and recovery. This project will combine spatially-resolved Magnetic Resonance Imaging of high-pressure flooding and exchange experiments with multi-scale modelling. The expected outcome is simultaneous carbon dioxide sequestration with enhanced energy production.",

Radiometric dates indicate that sediments in this vast area are late Miocene in age. This project will reveal how Australia’s wildlife responded to one of the world’s biggest climate changes and help better anticipate what will be required to ensure its survival into the future.

Much of Australia's mineral wealth is the result of the interaction of warm fluids with rocks deep in the Earth over geological timescales. The formation of ore deposits is governed by the physical chemistry of mineral dissolution and crystallisation, and by fluid flow through porous rocks and fractures. This project integrates innovation in geology, chemistry, and mineral engineering, and will deliver mineral-scale reaction models that will increase efficiency of in-situ mining and leaching technologies. Knowledge generated can be applied to improve mineral exploration, mining, and processing, contributing to unlocking billions of dollars’ worth of resources tied up in low grade, mineralogically complex ores.",

This project intends to provide definitive evidence of these keystones’ cellular level biogeochemical and metabolic capacity. Ultimately, this knowledge is expected to predict the resilience of ocean ecosystems and their response to change. The capacity to predict their dynamics will help provide investment clarity and increase healthy outcomes from activities involving human-ocean interactions such as recreation, food production and tourism.",

This project will resolve the roles of environmental drivers of soil respiration across forests; integrate mechanistic understanding of differing plant and microbial responses to temperature within a common modelling framework; and evaluate the implications of this knowledge in predictions of climatic impacts on terrestrial carbon cycling.",

As copper-gold deposits become increasingly difficult to find, and exploration budgets have been slashed, it is critical to reliably distinguish ore bearing from barren systems. Platinum group element geochemistry could make this distinction by pinpointing the timing of sulphide saturation in evolving magma systems.

This project aims to design and execute autonomous observations above (unmanned aerial vehicles), below (autonomous underwater vehicles) and within (wave-ice interaction buoys) sea ice on international Antarctic research voyages. The project intends to advance the parameterisation of wave-ice interaction, critical to the seasonal advance and retreat of Antarctic sea ice, in climate models that do not reproduce the observed trends in regional Antarctic sea ice extent. The project expects to improve prediction of sea ice’s responses and feedbacks to changes in ocean and atmospheric forcing around the Southern Ocean. This work should place Australia at the forefront of polar climate research. Greater accuracy in climate projections will help to optimise the balance between human populations, economic growth and environmental protection in an uncertain future.",

Uncertainties in predictions of natural systems due to observational and model error make this more difficult. It is anticipated that the results from this project will advance uncertainty analysis in hydrology and help understand how different types of data and information can inform model characterisation. This will be useful in providing vital information on the attributes and extent of uncertainty to inform water resources analysis, management and decision making.",

This project will compare forests that contrast strongly in seasonal drought stress, and use the information to develop a model designed for species-diverse forest, with subsequent potential global application.

This project will use the Great Barrier Reef as a testbed because it has both long time series (standard approach) and rich spatial data (new approach), and exhibits early warning signs.

This project aims to understand the relationship of mantle discontinuities beneath the Australian tectonic plate to mantle convection processes. Subducting slabs stagnate at different depths in the mantle, but the reason is not known. The Australian plate has complex boundaries which exhibit a range of subduction behaviours, making it an ideal location to study convection mechanisms. The project will use specialised seismic stations for detailed studies beneath New Zealand and Indonesia. The goal is to determine the relationship between seismic observations and geodynamical processes beneath Australasia, and understand how deeper mechanisms influence seismic activity and earthquake hazard at Earth's surface. Such detailed observations will help us to understand processes at the Earth's surface, with implications for earthquake hazard.",

Improved climate prediction on decadal time scales is urgently needed, but limited understanding of the system’s natural variability hampers progress. This knowledge will reduce uncertainty in near term climate projections, allowing more informed decision making about adaptation on the regional scale, particularly for sectors such as agriculture, health, water and ecosystem management (including bushfire control).",

This project aims to resolve the timing, rate of change, mechanisms and effects of past abrupt and extreme global climate change. These are uncertain for abrupt and extreme warming events in the recent geological record, due to difficulties comparing terrestrial and marine palaeoclimate and faunal records on radiocarbon timescales with independently dated ice cores over the last 50,000 years. By using yearly-resolved tree ring records, the project will discover when, how and what effect abrupt and extreme change had on global climate and species/ecosystems.",

Nearly everything known about the origin and evolution of the solar system comes from analysis of meteorite falls, but scientists have almost no constraint on where they come from. This project will address this constraint by tracking hundreds of meteorite falls, and pinpointing each one’s origin in the solar system. Benefits include capitalising on the innovations and technologies that underpinned the DFN, and leveraging a NASA partnership for administrative support and advanced instrumentation development. Tracking for space situational awareness is also expected to benefit Australian national security.",

This project aims to test the theory that a lack of Indigenous land management precipitated the collapse of Australia's mammal fauna.

Paradoxically, Australia’s most pressing extinction crisis could be due to too little human disturbance. This project will test Indigenous land management’s capacity to forestall further mammal declines and restore degraded ecosystems, and enhance Indigenous livelihoods. Anticipated outcomes include on-ground principles for integrating Indigenous knowledge into biodiversity conservation, and transformative insights on the interdependence of humans and their environment.",

This project will use seagrass archives to reconstruct the history of coastal ecosystems over millennia, identifying baseline conditions, the time-course of ecological change, cycles and thresholds of ecosystem dynamics driven by human and natural forces, and determining their role as biogeochemical sinks.

Uncertainty about how they do so limits attempts at accurate predictive climate modelling. This project will test conceptual models of SWW dynamics and provide essential boundary conditions for predictive climate models.

This project aims to solve the global problem of unsustainable coral reef fisheries by locating and learning from ‘bright spots’ in reefs. Bright spots are reefs in better condition than they should be, given the multiple drivers (e.g. markets and human population pressures) to which they are exposed. This project will use a global-scale analysis to identify bright spots, and field-based research to uncover the enabling social, economic and institutional conditions. Understanding these enabling conditions should help to formulate policy levers for more sustainable reef governance in other regions.",

This project intends to maximise the scope for rebuilding reef fisheries while ensuring short-term levels do not become too low. Like many developing countries, Indonesia wishes to rebuild its heavily over-exploited coral reef fisheries. Marine reserves allow fish populations to recover and replenish fished areas. However, because reserves remove fishing grounds, fish catches tend to decrease in the short-term while fish recover in reserves; a process that can take a decade. Loss of yield can be so burdensome that managers abandon fisheries. This research is intended to improve the economic security of fishers and food security, and inform World Bank and Australian aid programs.",

It also plans to create new software to enable time-varying estimates of the contributions of these sources, from which the changes in sea level over the past century can be reconstructed at any location, including in places where no local observations have been made.

This project is significant because of the potential importance of seagrass communities for nitrogen loss via denitrification in coastal systems and the importance of coastal systems in the global nitrogen budget.

Fossil biomolecules, unearthed from 1.6 billion years old sediments, draw a picture of ancient seas oscillating between blooms of purple and green bacteria, with waters rapidly alternating between toxic and sulphidic and rich in dissolved iron. Based on these observations, the project aims to discover the dynamic nature of primordial ecosystems, investigate how ancient seas were controlled by the Earth’s orbit around the sun, and explore how microorganisms may have formed the world’s largest zinc deposits.",

The project intends to enable full quantitative separation of magnetic mineral mixtures in natural materials to unlock details of important environmental processes. Most efforts to understand ancient variations of Earth’s magnetic field using palaeomagnetism, or climate change using environmental magnetism, are complicated by the presence of mixed assemblages of magnetic rock-forming minerals. Understanding the recording of palaeomagnetic information or decoding environmental processes requires separate quantification of each mineral component. The main aim of the project is to develop a method to unmix the magnetic components present in environmental and geological materials. The proposed approach is expected to unlock a new quantitative era in rock magnetism, and to have impacts in physics as well as Earth science.",

The spatial and temporal variations of the data may highlight the interplay of climate drivers, such as El Niño Southern Oscillation, and how they change the distribution of rainfall in the Pacific. This knowledge would increase our scientific understanding and enable better predictions of the recurrence of droughts and wet events in Australia.",

Fractures in rock provide interconnected, hydraulically conductive networks enabling large-volume fluid transport through sedimentary basins. The ability of a fracture to transmit fluid is primarily controlled by the in situ stress field, but also by rock strength, fracture plane orientation and roughness and pore-fluid pressure. We have a good understanding of in situ stress within many sedimentary basins, but know very little about the nature and origin of natural fractures. This project aims to provide a detailed, quantitative understanding of the nature and origin of natural fractures in the subsurface, which is critical for predicting fluid migration within aquifers, carbon dioxide storage sites, and geothermal and hydrocarbon reservoirs.",

However, their reliability relies on understanding their formation. Emerging knowledge from material sciences indicates that these biocarbonates form via transient precursors rather than direct precipitation from seawater, profoundly affecting their interpretation. This project plans to transfer this new understanding to the earth sciences using nanoscale analytical methods including in vitro geochemical partitioning experiments.

This project plans to use cutting-edge instrumentation to develop a novel method for dating geological materials formed in a critical time window for which no dating technique currently exists. The last million years of Earth’s history has seen dramatic changes in global climate and environment, with catastrophic volcanic eruptions and numerous other natural processes shaping landforms and ecosystems. A major challenge for studying these phenomena and their impacts is the dating of geological archives in the time window between 50 000 and 1 000 000 years. This project aims to develop a method for dating young volcanic rocks that can close this critical gap. The result would be a new dating tool with broad implications for the Quaternary sciences globally, including paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental reconstructions, natural hazards assessment, hominin evolution and archaeology.",

Plant canopy nitrogen concentrations decline in nearly every large-scale eCO2 study done on native soils. The project plans to explore how changes in ecosystem nitrogen balance occur, by investigating if leaf nitrogen declines under eCO2 due to the balance of plant activity versus changes in soil nitrogen availability. The outcomes are central to knowing the extent to which extra nitrogen ‘feeds’ the eCO2 fertilisation response and sustains long-term increases in productivity.

The projects plans to compile precisely dated time series of past interglacials that can be linked directly to these records, allowing robust comparisons between interglacial properties and changes in Earth's astronomical parameters.

By integrating geochemical, geochronological and microstructural datasets, this project aims to provide a novel framework for fluid–rock systems in the lithosphere. Plate tectonics argues that continental interiors are usually stable, rigid and undeformable, yet mountain belts have formed in these locations. Their existence suggests that strong crust can be weakened to allow the accommodation of deforming forces, but the underlying causes for this change in behaviour are not clear. This project aims to investigate the largely unexplored impact of fluid flow on the characteristics of intraplate deformation. This would improve our understanding of what modulates the strength of continental crust, including its susceptibility to seismic activity, and the ways in which fluids interact with the deep crust, including their mineralisation potential.",

Predation by introduced predators is the most significant cause of fauna decline in Australia and New Zealand. Current predator–prey theory is based on population-level processes and predator control used to protect threatened wildlife assumes that the removal of each predator is equally important. However, evidence suggests that in many cases only a few individual predators are responsible for population decline. If the physical or behavioural characteristics of successful individual predators can be identified then predator profiling can be used to control problem animals and improve the efficacy of feral animal control programs.",

This project intends to investigate the tectonic drivers of (ultra-)high temperature metamorphism in eastern Indonesia. Subduction zones – where one of Earth's plates collapses beneath another – drive the formation of mountain belts and produce high pressure and high temperature metamorphic rocks. However, it is typically very difficult when investigating mature mountain belts to interpret how subduction was exactly involved. Eastern Indonesia is one of the few places where active subduction can be linked directly to recent mountain building. Better understanding of how complex subduction dynamics and how mountain belts form is intended to assist natural hazard assessment in earthquake-prone areas.",

Firestorms cannot be suppressed, and so accurate and timely warnings of their occurrence, combined with appropriate community responses, are the only way of mitigating their effects.

Using unique models and technics, the project aims to demonstrate that long-term exposure to the blue green algae toxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) leads to uptake, accumulation and toxicity within the central nervous system. The risks for heath, mechanisms of contamination and toxicity of BMAA are very poorly understood. Algal blooms cost the Australian community more than $250 million each year and represent a major health issue for human and fauna. This project aims to be the first to fully characterise BMAA mechanisms of contamination and neurotoxicity and to highlight the major environmental risk of exposure of human to BMAA. It also aims to develop new and unique detection and quantification tools for BMAA.",

This project intends to quantify the role that aquatic habitats play in fisheries, and to help identify where to restore degraded aquatic habitats. Fisheries are a globally important resource but their status is declining in many regions, often because of the loss of aquatic habitats. However, the role of habitat in fishery declines is poorly quantified, and new models are needed that integrate existing datasets to attribute change in a fishery to change in its habitats. The project aims to develop a new statistical analysis to examine the role of habitat loss in the global status of fisheries and how multiple human impacts to habitats affect fisheries, to decide how we can best protect aquatic habitats.",

NanoMin: quantitative mineral mapping of nanoscale processes: \nThe project seeks to establish an electron microscope-based mineral mapping and analysis facility to provide rapid, quantitative and statistically reliable mineralogical, petrographic and metallurgical data unobtainable by other means in fine-grained materials. The proposed equipment can identify minerals in complex mixtures of sub-µm-grain size materials by virtue of an integrated software and hardware system called NanoMin which incorporates a spectral deconvolution engine combined with a mineral spectra database. A key limitation in understanding complex materials is sub-micron to nanometer scale spatial variability of mineralogical phases. Imaging and quantifying these phases is now possible with the NanoMin system. This promises to open up petrological, geobiological, and materials science research in complex fine-grained materials.",

This project will use a hierarchy of oceanic models of increasing complexity combined with a unique spiny lobster data set to investigate the relationship between larval health, physiology and environmental variables and how this affects survival and successful recruitment into the fishery. An understanding of these complex relationships is expected to enable the first predictions of larval survival and settlement in a region of accelerated ocean warming, and provide critical information for sustainable fisheries management.",

Supporting hydrochemical data will be used to determine the relationship of the isotopes with environmental processes. The project impact will be the development of new methods to help understand our groundwater resource. The improved process understanding will be translated to groundwater management in general.

This project aims to use a traits-based modelling framework, incorporating variability both within and between species, to forecast the resilience of freshwater fishes in northern Australia to impending environmental change. While northern Australian rivers are among the most pristine and productive on earth, they face profound change due to human activity. Emerging evidence suggests that flexibility in functional traits (e.g. life history, physiology, behaviour, diet) may result in resilience to environmental change. This project aims to provide decision-makers with essential information and new tools to underpin future planning and resource management.",

Understanding groundwater age is critical for sustainable management and environmental tracers are increasingly used for this purpose. However, groundwater samples are inevitably mixtures of water of different ages. Since for most tracers the relationship between tracer concentration and age is not linear, different tracers can produce different mean ages for the sample. This project aims to determine whether it is possible to determine moments of the groundwater age distributions from measurements made with different environmental tracers. The project also aims to examine whether the degree of heterogeneity within the aquifer can be determined from the disparity between ages obtained with different tracers. This project aims to tackle the largest problem with using groundwater chemistry to estimate water age – that mixing processes in the subsurface are never known. Solving this problem will allow much more accurate estimates of groundwater velocity and aquifer recharge rates. The groundwater industry contributes an estimated $6.8 billion per annum to the Australian economy, and this project will contribute to the sustainable management of the groundwater resource.",

This proposal aims to combine exceptional Australian fossils with recent advances in 3D imaging, biomechanics, and evolutionary analysis to discover how the secrets to the success of baleen whales first evolved.",

This project aims to prevent cane toads, which are causing ecological havoc across tropical Australia, from breeding successfully. Attempts to control toad populations have had little impact, but recent research has revealed a new possibility — exploiting the toads' own weapons for intraspecific conflict. Larval cane toads compete intensely with other larval cane toads and as a result, have evolved a way to kill off their competitors. Toad tadpoles produce chemicals that have devastating effects on younger members of their own species, but not on native species. By deploying those chemicals, this project could develop a novel and powerful form of invader control.",

The project plans to use a combination of continuous concentration and stable isotope measurements, process measurements and advanced numerical modelling across a range of undisturbed to disturbed systems. It is intended that this project will provide information for conceptualising, calibrating and verifying models, including green-house gas production. Good models, and the data that support them, such as that provided by this study, are critical for the efficient allocation of management resources in Australian coastal systems, including by our partners.

This project involves Melbourne Water, the Department of Environment and Primary Industries, and East Gippsland Water in developing tools to evaluate mitigation options that will protect our water supplies and increase the resilience of Australian communities to bushfire. Major bushfires in south-east Australia in 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2013 were followed by storms that triggered extreme soil erosion events in catchments, contaminating water supplies and damaging critical infrastructure. The capacity to mitigate the risk of interruption to the water supplies of our cities and towns in a more fire-prone future is currently limited by our knowledge of where, why, and how often these post-fire contamination events will occur. This project aims to address these knowledge gaps.",

This project aims to use novel acoustic techniques to detect and capture invasive frog species to protect native species.

Male frogs call to attract mates, and answer calls they hear. Using new acoustic technologies, these behaviours can be exploited to detect species and attract gravid females for removal. This project aims to combine an early warning system (electronic listening) and trap (calling and catching), which can be customised to any invasive frog, and use it to detect and remove cane toads, especially in low density populations.",

Clouds and atmospheric turbulence are also a problem for weather and climate prediction, the conceptual understanding of which now has evident flaws. The hypothesis of this project is that these two problems are strongly linked, and that this link may be exploited to solve problems across disciplines.

This project hopes to distinguish the vital role of vertical mixing from that of horizontal mixing by (i) developing algorithms to construct neutral density surfaces in climate models, (ii) formulating new inverse techniques to deduce the amount of vertical mixing in various ocean regions, and (iii) incorporating new approaches to ocean mixing processes and thermodynamics into ocean models.",

This project aims to shed new light on global element cycles in the deep Earth and how they connect to the evolution of the exospheres – one of the hottest topics in geosciences. It also aims to produce key knowledge of the extraction and transport of elements from the deep Earth to the surface, which may provide valuable information for resource exploration. Using novel integrated elemental and isotopic approaches, this program aims to track the origin and fate of sulfur, selenium and tellurium during accretion and subsequent redistribution in fluids to Earth’s surface. This new knowledge is critical to understanding how these and other elements of strategic and economic importance, such as the Platinum Group Elements, are extracted from the deep Earth and transported to the surface.",

This project aims to develop new geobiological tools for gold exploration and processing that are rooted in a fundamental understanding of geobiological gold cycling. Given the high production costs, the sustainability of the Australian gold industry relies strongly on innovation. Yet, there are many gaps in our fundamental understanding of bio (geo)chemical gold dispersion and precipitation. This project aims to fill these gaps by linking biochemical pathways of gold mobilisation and resistance in bacteria to its transport and biomineralisation. This would enable the development of protein-based biosensors, bioindicators and nanovectors. These would support the development of exploration and bioaccumulation technologies that allow more economically sustainable and environmentally viable mining practices, such as enhancing production from subeconomic ore.",

The project plans to assess the reproducibility of environmental research and develop systematic review methods that account for bias in published research. In this way, it seeks to contribute to the standards for statistical inference and reporting in the discipline, and facilitate a cultural shift to ‘Open Science’ to ensure a more reliable evidence base for environmental decisions.

The goal of this project is to use magnetotellurics to measure mantle hydrogen content to aid in the discovery of new mineral deposits. Hydrogen controls the strength of Earth’s mantle and is a vital component of the systems that form giant ore deposits. However, mantle hydrogen content is unconstrained. Ore-forming fluids hydrate the mantle pathways on which they travel. The first aim of this project is to image these fluid pathways to improve mineral exploration techniques. Plate tectonic models assume that the lithospheric mantle is dehydrated but existing data from magnetotellurics and mantle rocks show high hydrogen contents. The second aim of this project is to create a map of the hydrogen content of the plates, which may lead to new models for continental evolution and mantle dynamics.",

Earth's response to ice unloading - a unique GPS measurement from Antarctica: This project aims to deploy geophysical equipment including global navigation satellite systems within Antarctica to understand how Earth responds to changes in stress (rheology) within the crust and upper mantle (the upper ~660 km). It exploits a globally-unique natural experiment that commenced in 2002 with the break-up of the Larsen B Ice Shelf and which was followed by large-scale ice-mass unloading and rapid surface deformation. New broadband passive seismic and geodetic deformation measurements offer the promise of resolving a dichotomy between laboratory and millennial-scale determinations of Earth rheology through uniquely studying a time-scale mid-way between these extremes, whilst further strengthening Australia's emerging expertise in polar geophysics.",

This proposal aims to better understand how tropical intraseasonal variability (periods of 40 to 60 days) influences the chemical components of the global atmosphere. The results of the research aim to improve regional air-quality forecasts on weekly and monthly timescales. The highly vertically resolved ozone concentrations from the surface up to 20 kilometres, measured by balloon-borne instruments called ozonesondes, will be used as a dynamical tracer. The knowledge gained from the ozonesonde data will be used to elucidate the chemical origins of the tropical variability related to biomass burning activities and convective lightning, as well as the subtropical variability related to the polar vortex dynamics.",

Exploration on the modern seafloor reveals the deposits of deep (greater than 1 000 metres) silicic explosive eruptions, yet theory predicts that explosivity at these depths is largely suppressed. In 2012 the largest and deepest silicic submarine explosive eruption ever recorded took place at depths up to 1 600 metres, also challenging this theory. This project leverages a United States of America research expedition to the eruption site. This project aims to constrain the physical and chemical factors that control explosivity using cutting-edge technologies. Australia's ancient submarine volcanoes host highly economic ore deposits. This project aims to enhance the ability to interpret ancient volcanic settings, thereby improving the potential for new ore deposit discoveries.",

This project aims to examine variability and predictability of these climatic extremes and associated mechanisms. It will be the first to systematically investigate sources of predictability by incorporating the most comprehensive novel databases of both multi-model decadal climate simulations and observed climate extremes. This study is significant as it will lead to a vastly improved understanding of variability and predictability of climate extremes. This will enable improved climate predictions on seasonal to decadal timescales and ultimately improve longer-term projections.",

Kimberlite magmas are very rich in volatiles (for example carbon dioxide and water); they are the major host of diamonds and provide the deepest samples from Earth's mantle. The primary compositions of these melts can provide unique information on the nature of the deep mantle. However, kimberlite melts mix and react with wall rocks on the way up, obscuring their primary composition. To see through these secondary processes, the project aims to use a novel approach integrating the study of melt inclusions in magmatic minerals with analysis of radiogenic and stable isotopes, and investigating reactions between kimberlite magmas and wall-rock fragments. The project aims to provide new understanding of the constraints on melting processes and recycling of crustal material in the deep mantle.",

This project aims to resolve the importance and drivers of this pathway, along with the ultimate fate of the carbon once it reaches the aquatic environment.

The Wilson Cycle describes the life of an ocean in three phases: opening and spreading, foundering of its passive margins and development of new subduction zones, and consumption and closure. It has been suggested that new subduction zones are difficult to form and thereby they are more likely to spread from ocean to ocean like a sort of invasive mechanism. This project aims to make use of laboratory models and plate kinematic modelling to understand how subduction zones are initiating and propagating in the Atlantic. The project aims to provide clues on how ancient oceans may have closed and whether the Atlantic is already in its turning point.",

Changes in the Southern Ocean abyssal circulation are linked with dramatic climate events, yet the associated dynamics are poorly understood. This project aims to determine the fundamental dynamic processes driving abyssal flows, and diagnose impacts of recent and projected climate change. The project also aims to bridge the large gap between conceptual and observational understanding of this vital limb of the ocean's overturning circulation. A significant innovation is that it will be the first study of the Southern Ocean abyss using realistic global-scale models capable of simulating all the key dynamic processes. Results will guide Southern Ocean observation programs, explain observed changes, and reduce uncertainties in climate projections.",

A fundamental challenge for environmental policies is the different timescales over which ecological and financial costs and benefits occur. For example, whilst revegetation to offset land clearing incurs immediate costs, it can take decades for it to become suitable habitat for wildlife. These long time lags can lead to inefficiencies in spending and poor environmental outcomes. This project aims to develop novel approaches for evaluating the future impacts of environmental policies and new methods for improving their design. It is intended that the methods be tested and demonstrated in the policy context of biodiversity offsetting, which is set to play a key role in nature conservation globally.",

The project is significant and innovative because it develops two fundamentally new types of tracer work, one at the sediment-animal level and one at the within-molecule level. The expected outcomes include a new toolkit for tracing the hidden connections between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.",

This project aims to develop innovative numerical methods to understand the dynamics, carbon export, and trophic structure of zooplankton. The trophic links between phytoplankton, zooplankton and fisheries are unknown. The size- frequency distribution of zooplankton (size spectrum) is an innovative method for estimating their growth, predation and production as food for fish. Analysis of a global synthesis of zooplankton size distributions from tropical to polar environments are expected to reveal these vital rates of pelagic ecosystems. The zooplankton rates will reveal, for the first time, the link between phytoplankton and fisheries, and will significantly improve ecosystem models and global assessments of environmental change.",

Migration of volatile fluid and molten rock controls many Earth processes including rock deformation and the formation of mineral and energy deposits. Deep crustal fluids are hard to study directly, and their characteristics are usually inferred from lower crustal rock brought to the surface by erosion. For over 30 years one such rock called charnockite has been used to argue that lower crust is dehydrated by influx of carbon dioxide-rich fluid, while other evidence supports dehydration by water extraction in silicate melt. This project aims to use the shape, distribution and chemistry of mineral grains to trace the passage of volatiles and melt through charnockite, constrain the nature of lower crustal fluids and resolve a long-standing controversy.",

This project aims to document historical changes in the spatial grain of the patch burning mosaic in an Arnhem Land savannah with an unbroken history of management by Aboriginal people, and  in adjacent areas where traditional management has ceased. The mosaic's spatial grain will be inferred by mapping the individual ages of the long-lived conifer Callitris intratropica. Prior research has shown that Callitris individuals can be reliably aged, and population structures are very sensitive to fire regimes: saplings only establish if unburnt for 10 years. This research is expected to provide the first direct test of the hypothesis that Aboriginal people maintained fine-grained fire mosaics in savannas, and inform bushfire policy debates.",

Every cloud drop is formed from a microscopic aerosol particle, known as a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In unpolluted environments the CCN particles originate from biogenic sources. Determining the magnitude and driving factors of biogenic aerosol production in different ecosystems is crucial to the development and improvement of climate models. This project aims to determine the mechanisms of new particle production from one of the biggest ecosystems in Australia, the Great Barrier Reef. It is expected that the project will establish whether marine aerosol along the Queensland coast is coral-derived and show that this aerosol can affect the CCN concentration and therefore cloud formation and the hydrological cycle.",

Due to the availability of new Australian research infrastructure, large steps forward are now possible with modest investment.

This project aims to reconstruct sedimentary processes and evolution of key coastal plains in southern Australia. These low-lying coasts, and the settlements and infrastructure on them, are vulnerable to inundation and shoreline erosion. Past behaviour of different types of coasts will be determined by combining innovative geospatial techniques to map morphology and past changes, geophysical imaging of stratigraphy and geochronology. The outcome will be models that explain responses to sediment availability, past storm history and sea-level changes. This will benefit sustainable coastal planning and management, providing geomorphological evidence to support erosion hazard assessments of these and adjacent coasts.",

This project aims to map and model how and when fault (re)activation occurred by integrating multi-method thermochronological and structural data on major Meso-Cenozoic Central Asian fault systems. The resulting time-integrated tectonic model will aid in the understanding of the India-Eurasia collision, the building of the mountainous Central Asian landscape and its influence on the Asian climate.",

Attempts to reduce conflict between development and conservation are increasingly reliant upon environmental offsetting: generating an environmental benefit to compensate for environmental damage elsewhere. However, whether different offset approaches can achieve their goal of ‘no net loss’ of biodiversity is unknown. By building simulations of the long-term biodiversity consequences (both intended and unintended) of current offset approaches, This project aims to test how each approach and associated sources of uncertainty influence the long-term persistence of biodiversity. It will identify limitations of biodiversity offsetting, shed new light on the most effective approaches, and help develop global standards for offsetting biodiversity loss.",

This project aims to use state-of-the-art geodynamical models to determine how deep-mantle heterogeneities are transported into a plume and how such heterogeneities are mixed during plume ascent. This will facilitate the linking, for the first time, of geochemical variations at volcanic hotspots to the deep-mantle's thermo-chemical structure, under an Earth-like, fluid-dynamical framework.",

El Niño and La Niña events have a profound influence on Australian drought conditions and rainfall. Forecasting is hampered by short climate records, which do not capture the full range of El Niño dynamics. This project aims to generate records of unprecedented length and spatial coverage from key sites across the western and central equatorial Pacific. Five hundred years of continuous, monthly-resolution climate data will be integrated with output from state-of-the-art climate model simulations to distil the key processes that cause El Niño to vary. This project aims to provide major advances in determining the full range of El Niño and La Niña behaviour, leading to improved forecasts of future changes, with consequences for Australia's water security.",

This project aims to experimentally manipulate the design of artificial structures to achieve multipurpose ecological objectives. Artificial structures such as buildings and roads have featured in terrestrial urban landscapes for many years, but have only more recently begun encroaching on aquatic environments. Most marine artificial structures lack the innovative design solutions required to mitigate their ecological impacts and provide essential ecosystem services such as pollution abatement. This project will investigate the efficacy of these designs with both classical measures of diversity and structure and novel measures of ecosystem function. The project aims to provide essential information to inform the design of future marine urban developments.",

Recent studies show that fugitive methane emissions associated with coal seam gas extraction pose a source of greenhouse gasses. In addition to the possible environmental impacts of methane emissions, quantifying the magnitude of emissions has potentially significant implications for future tax liabilities that could change the economics of the unconventional energy boom in Australia. The proposed research by an interdisciplinary team representing regulators, industry, and university researchers would establish a methodology for quantifying the flux of methane from gas fields. It would establish the range of natural baselines and determine the major sources of methane emissions using newly available highly sensitive instruments.",

This project aims to compare novel fertiliser practices claimed to maximise benefits from soil microbial processes with traditional fertiliser practices which can override biological processes, including beneficial plant-microbial symbioses. This will enable a rigorous evaluation of fertiliser-herbicide interactions to clarify whether soil microbial benefits can be included as part of weed control programs.",

How estuaries respond to human pressures is highly variable with some such as the Gippsland Lakes succumbing to algal blooms, whilst other heavily nutrient laden systems such as the Werribee Estuary support extremely high fish populations. This project aims to lead to an understanding of the links between freshwater flow, blue-green algal blooms, and recruitment of a key fishery species, black bream. The outcome of the project aims to give catchment managers greater confidence in setting levels of environmental flows that will both support fish populations but also mitigate against algal blooms.",

The Hub will develop and apply cutting-edge basin simulation approaches to transform the seeding and testing of basin exploration models, extending their viability to complex, inaccessible remote and deep exploration targets. The  Hub will fuse multidimensional data into five dimensional basin models (space and time, with uncertainty estimates) by coupling the evolution of mantle flow, crustal deformation, erosion and sedimentary processes, achieving a quantum leap in basin modelling and petroleum systems analysis.",

Compound-specific isotope analysis yields much more information than is available through bulk methods. The problem has been that the separations were labour-intensive and employed complex wet chemistry. New methods reduce the work-load enough to make compound-specific studies possible.

This project will undertake the first direct numerical simulations examining the complex dynamics of melting of ice-shelves in the presence of convection and turbulence, while translating the results to improve ocean models.

This project will investigate the impact of environmental change on larval energetics of molluscs on the southeast (SE) coast of Australia. The SE coast of Australia is a climate hotspot characterised by rising ocean temperatures, fluctuations in salinity and we expect in the near future ocean acidification (OA). Mollusc larvae show extreme sensitivity to OA, but the impacts of other stressors remains unknown. It is predicted that OA will reduce the capacity of larvae to cope with temperature and salinity, particularly when food supply is low and in populations which have had no previous exposure to OA. Understanding the response of mollusc larvae to environmental change will support ecologically and economically significant mollusc populations over this century.",

For most of Earth’s history, single-celled organisms were the only forms of life on the planet. Not until roughly 600 million years ago do fossils of multicellular animals appear in the rock record. Explanations for the Ediacaran rise of multicellularity include extreme climate change, meteorite impact and oxygenation of the global ocean. Evaluation of these hypotheses is complicated by the fact that stratigraphic records that span the appropriate time interval are rare. This project is focused on the carbon, oxygen, and zinc isotopic records preserved by Ediacaran marine rocks in the Amadeus Basin of central Australia. Results will contribute to a more complete record of fluctuations in ocean chemistry during a key interval of Earth history.",

This project will resolve whether advective pore water exchange and associated underground respiration represents the missing component of mangrove carbon and greenhouse gas budgets. This innovative project will examine the previously overlooked concept that crab burrow flushing is a major driver of biogeochemical reactions in mangroves. It will use a combination of new experimental and modelling approaches and will contribute to closing a significant gap in our understanding of the coastal carbon cycle.",

These interactions are often ignored in conservation decision making.

Using a novel application of optimisation approaches pioneered in artificial intelligence research, we aim to demonstrate how food web theory can guide the management of multiple species. In doing so, we will also test the effectiveness of widely used approaches to multi-species management, such as keystone species, umbrella species and bottom-up control.",

The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in the uptake of heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the deep ocean. This uptake depends strongly on mixing processes due to ocean eddies, which are especially important in regions of steep topography, leading to localised mixing hot spots. These ocean eddies have scales of 10-100km and therefore can not be resolved in current global climate models. This project will examine these mixing processes using a combination of observations and innovative modelling approaches. This knowledge will be used to improve the representation of eddy processes in state-of-the-art climate models, which will ultimately allow Australia to more effectively respond to the challenge of climate change.",

In a world where few intact reefs remain, the goal of this project is to find ways to restore degraded reefs. Recent research has identified the species responsible for removing harmful algae from coral reefs, while advances in mariculture provide us with the capacity to rear these critically important reef fish species. Combining captive rearing, experimental manipulations, and a global analysis of the functional capacity of herbivorous fishes, in intact, degraded and human-modified systems, the research will explore the potential for restoring, or boosting, the capacity of reefs to withstand disturbance. The goal is to provide the scientific knowledge required to directly modify the key processes operating on coral reefs. ",

Water resource management is one of the greatest challenges facing sustainable agriculture and urban populations across southern Australia. Key players driving catastrophic droughts in southern Australia are the tropical Indian Ocean Dipole and polar Southern Annual Mode climate systems, which affect moisture availability and transport pathways. This collaborative research project draws together a uniquely-skilled research team to develop targeted coral, ice and cave reconstructions of these climate systems and their impacts on Australian rainfall through the last millennium. This fundamental new knowledge of the drivers of Australian rainfall variability will aid improved predictability of future changes in our valuable water resources.  ",

This project will use new technology and novel methods to investigate the precursor sediments of iron formations and their temporal relationship with periods of global magmatism and atmospheric oxygenation.

This project proposes novel methods for determination of the half-life and branching ratio of 40K, by age comparison against well calibrated 87Rb-87Sr and 40K-40Ca geochronometers. The ages with all isotopic systems will be determined in the same minerals, thus eliminating the main source of uncertainty in the previous studies.

Both tropical coral and temperate rocky reefs are abundant features of Australia's coastline, yet their hydrodynamics (waves, currents and water levels) are poorly understood relative to other coastal environments such as beaches. This project will elucidate the complex hydrodynamic processes when waves interact with the steep-slopes and large bottom roughness of reefs, by establishing an international research program combining laboratory and field measurements with numerical modelling. The improved process-understanding of reef hydrodynamics developed through this project will lead to significant advances in our ability to predict the impacts of extreme events (for example, storms and tsunamis) and climate change on coasts, both here and abroad.",

Deformation up to large strains and rotations is important in rocks, metals, polymers, and biomaterials. Computational mechanics is a standard tool for modelling such deformations. However, in earth sciences, mechanical theories use small-strain formulations or large-strain approaches with classical stress rates. Classical stress rates can lead to incorrect stored energies. This project proposes to test a new large-strain theory tailored to rocks experimentally, and to apply it to a pivotal geological problem: shear zone formation. The project will advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanics and energetics of rock deformation and provide a novel tool for the modelling of large deformations.",

In many hydrothermal ore-forming systems, the ore is associated with inclusions of both aqueous brine and organic liquid (petroleum).

This project proposes to conduct an experimental and field-based study on the chemical behaviour of gold in aqueous-organic and organic fluid systems, to determine which type of liquid is more important for gold mobilisation in a competitive situation. This study will provide much-needed data for more accurate modelling of ore systems, furthering our understanding and facilitating mineral exploration. ",

The May 2011 discovery of the oldest fossiliferous amber deposit from Australia, and all of Southern Gondwana, provides a unique opportunity to study the only recorded terrestrial biotas of this age on the continent. Employing new imaging techniques (MicroXCT-400, X-ray ultramicroscope and Synchrotron radiation), the new fossils dated as 90 million years old will be extracted virtually in three-dimensional to capture the finest details from this major palaeontological find. The outcomes of the study will attract much national and international attention as the researchers identify the first Mesozoic organisms of this age living in habitats in and close to the resin-producing forests, thus opening an entirely new window of opportunities in this field.",

The abundance and distribution of Earth's water and soil resources are strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal variability of climatic parameters.

This project will use novel isotopic techniques to study the links between climate variability, chemical weathering, which produces soil, and sediment transport, which affects fluvial systems and water resources. The composition of stable lithium, boron and calcium isotopes, and of radioactive uranium-series isotopes in sedimentary records will shed new light on our understanding of these processes.",

This project will reconcile this paradox through high-pressure experiments that will simulate subduction of continental sediments into the deep mantle. These experiments will provide the first empirical constraints on the role of sediment-derived fluids in mantle metasomatism and the origin of economically-rich potassic magmas, and the nature of the ultrarefractory continental component that ultimately reaches the plume source for ocean-island basalts.",

Invasive species have detrimental effects on human health, the economy and native biodiversity. This study will address a major gap in our scientific understanding of invasions by undertaking the first large-scale examination of the role of interactions between species in determining the dynamics and outcomes of biological invasions. The project will integrate data, across four continents, on dispersal, demography, breeding and behavioural interactions into one framework to create a cutting-edge model of invasion dynamics, using the highly invasive common myna as a model system. This novel approach will significantly advance theoretical developments in invasion biology and will inform pest management and threat mitigation efforts globally.",

These two processes are mediated through the functional relationships of soil organic matter and clay mineral interactions in soils. This project investigates nanoscale organomineral association underlying microaggregate formation and stability, as well as the distribution and microbial decomposition of carbon within microaggregates using a suite of advanced spectroscopic, molecular and isotopic techniques.",

The aim of the proposed project is to determine whether variations in cloud implied by this new explanation are supported by observations and process models. If the explanation is confirmed, then for the first time in over 30 years of intense research it will be possible to determine the long-term severity of global warming by examining the present-day atmosphere.

The method relates the abundance or 'clumping' of rare isotopes (for example, carbon dioxide of mass 47 as carbon-13, oxygen-18, oxygen-16) extracted from carbonates to their formation temperature and is independent of the oxygen-18:oxygen-16 value of the host water from which the mineral precipitated. The materials to be investigated span the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition and will provide robust past temperature estimates and the delta-oxygen-18 values of waters, thereby permitting hydrological balances (for example, precipitation/evaporation) to be constructed.

In addition, the study will provide practical information about how economically important hydrothermal ore deposits form on the seafloor and it will test models for orogenic gold mineralisation.  ",

This project will present a method to develop models for these biases.

Predictions on how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem functions and services require a well-developed understanding of its effects on plant litter decomposition, because this process is a key component of the global carbon cycle. This project will advance this understanding by addressing several key questions (for example, relative importance of decomposition versus other drivers of environmental change; and temporal variation in biodiversity effects on decomposition), using forest streams as model systems. These experiments will mimic realistic extinction events across climatic gradients, enabling predictions to be made at large scales.",

The concept of small-scale convection currents from about 100-400 km below the Earth’s surface is a model proposed to explain the origins of intraplate volcanoes and mountains. However, direct evidence for the physical reality of small-scale convection cells is generally weak. This project will develop a novel seismological approach combining both ambient noise and earthquake data that can image such small-scale upper mantle convection.  The outcomes of this project will help to fill the gap left in the Plate Tectonic paradigm by its inability to explain intraplate geological activity (volcanoes, earthquakes, mountains), which would be a significant step towards unifying conceptual models about how the Earth works.",

The circulation of water between the surface and the deep interior lubricates the internal dynamics that keep Earth geologically alive; it is crucial to most Earth systems, including the evolution of the hydrospher/atmosphere/biosphere, and the development of giant ore deposits. However, the origin, abundance, speciation and movements of fluids inside Earth are largely unknown, and represent key issues in modern geoscience. This CoE will integrate previously disparate fields - geology, tectonics, geochemistry, petrophysics, geophysics and dynamic modelling - to understand the workings of Earth's deep plumbing system.",

This work will, for the first time, provide a clear indication of the relationship between the physical environment on the shelf and the distribution of benthic assemblages, predict future changes in temperature and nutrients in the area, and predict the effects of these changes on the associated benthic biota.
